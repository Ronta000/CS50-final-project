#### Description:FocusHive is a productivity web app designed to help students study effectively, stay focused, and manage all their learning tools in one place.When a user opens the site, they can register or log in. After logging in, they are redirected to the Dashboard, which displays the total number of study sessions, total study hours, and a detailed record of each session including its date, duration, and time (which reset every week). At the bottom, there are two suggestion boxes that encourage the user to try Quiz Mode or Flashcards.Users can start a new session from the Session page, which includes two types of sessions. The first is the Normal Session, where the user sets the study and break time manually. If the timer is used for studying, the session is recorded; if it is used for a break, the data is not saved. The second type is the Smartly Customized Session, which begins with a default 25-minute study and 5-minute break timer. Then, the app asks the user to rate their focus level (1–5) and how they feel about the subject (1–5). The total score determines the next timer setting: a total of 2–3 gives 15 minutes of study and 10 minutes of break; 4–6 gives 25 minutes of study and 5 minutes of break; 7–8 gives 30 minutes of study and 5 minutes of break; and 9–10 gives 35 minutes of study and 3 minutes of break. This system helps make study sessions more personalized and adaptive.The Task Board allows users to add, mark as completed, or delete tasks. It resets automatically every week to help users stay organized and maintain a clear workflow.The Flashcards feature allows users to create cards with a front and back side to help with memorization. Once a user creates at least five flashcards, Quiz Mode becomes available. Quiz Mode automatically generates a quiz from the user’s flashcards and displays a final score after completion.Overall, FocusHive helps students stay motivated, track their progress, and manage their learning in one place. It combines study sessions, tasks, flashcards, and quizzes into a single, easy-to-use platform that encourages consistency, focus, and self-improvement.Technologies used: Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Developed by Rawnaa Ahmed Hisham Ahmed, Rawan El-meslawy, Malak Abd Al-Azeem
